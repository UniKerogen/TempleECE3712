## Intro to EMF with Dr.Silage Matlab Code
#### Assignment 1 will be the project 1 code:
  **Matlab Project on Electrostatics.**
  Using the discrete summation solution in MATLAB of the integral form of Coulomb’s Law with discrete charges ΔQ from the surface charge density ρ S and surface area ΔS, determine the resulting E at a point P(x,y,z)
