Project 1 Theory 1 is not working as expected. The user input function section can still work.

Project 1 Theory 2 has the proper setup. However, the calculation is not not working.

Project 1 Branch 1 is the calculation for Theory 2 on Plate 1. In order to run this part, RUN Theory 2 first.

Project 1 Branch 2 is the calculation for Theory 2 on Plate 2. In order to run this part, RUN Theory 2 first.

Project 1 MagEZSurface is the calculation for the magnitude for Electric Field on certain Z-axis point. 
  The result will be displayed in a 3D graph.
  
Project 1 Subplot 1 is plotting vector of Electric Field on certain Z-axis point.
  It still needs some working. Graph should be reasonable.

How to get a functional code:
  1.Use the first part from the Theory 2 till the nasty for loop. 
  2.Get the section of the input for the Theory 1 and attach it behind.
  3.Get the calcualtion branch from Branch 1 and attach it behind.
  4.Get the calculation branch from Branch 2 and attach it behind.
  5.Uncomment the output function and change some input values for output.
  6.Get the graphing function from Subplot 1 and attach it behind.
  NOTICES: It may take a while to run the funtion!
