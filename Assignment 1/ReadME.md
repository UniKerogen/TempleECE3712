# Matlab Project on Electrostatics.

## Using the discrete summation solution in MATLAB of the integral form of Coulomb’s Law with discrete charges ΔQ from the surface charge density ρ S and surface area ΔS, determine the resulting E at a point P(x,y,z)

**Project 1 Compiled Theory 2** is the combination of the code mentioned above. It works. Once change the DS to a much smaller number, it will take a while to generate the result as there are much more number for it to compile.

**Brief Explaination for Compiled 2** will give a general description for the Compiled Theory 2.
