Project 1 Theory 1 is not working as expected. The user input function section can still work.

Project 1 Theory 2 has the proper setup. However, the calculation is not not working.

Project 1 Branch 1 is the calculation for Theory 2 on Plate 1. In order to run this part, RUN Theory 2 first.

Project 1 MagEZSurface is the calculation for the magnitude for Electric Field on certain Z-axis point. 
  The result will be displayed in a 3D graph.
  
Project 1 Subplot 1 is plotting vector of Electric Field on certain Z-axis point.
  It still needs some working.
